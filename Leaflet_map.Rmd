```{r}
library(leaflet)

my_map <- leaflet() %>%
          addTiles() %>%
          addMarkers(lat=43.979255, lng= 15.384742, 
             popup="A five year old child has drawn a heart on this map!") %>%
          addRectangles(lat1 = 43.982812, lng1 = 15.376512, 
                        lat2 = 43.973462, lng2 = 15.389884)
